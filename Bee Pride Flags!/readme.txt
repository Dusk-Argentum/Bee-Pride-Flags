Hello! Thank you for checking out this Minecraft resource pack. This resource pack turns your bees into flying pride flags!

REQUIREMENTS:

The latest Minecraft: Java Edition snapshot (currently 19w34a).

HOW TO INSTALL:

1) Download the project by clicking the green "Clone or Download" button above the folder list. Select "Download ZIP".

2) Once the download completes, extract the folder's contents anywhere on your computer. It is suggested you extract them to an empty folder in your desktop, or other commonly-accessed document storage area.

3) After extracting the contents of the main folder to an empty folder, copy the folder (not the contents of!) that is titled after the pride flag you wish to use.

4) Navigate to your .minecraft folder (typically "C:\Users\[YOURNAME]\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft" on Windows).

5) Open the folder titled "resourcepacks".

6) Paste the folder of the pride flag you copied into the resourcepacks folder.

7) Enter the game (ensure you're on the latest snapshot; at the time of writing, it is 19w34a).

8) Open the settings menu, go to Options, then Resource Packs.

9) On the left, there is a panel titled Available Resource Packs. You should see a resource pack titled the same as the folder you pasted into resourcepacks. Hover your cursor over it, and click the triangle to activate the pack.

10) You're done! Go look for your flying pride flags in the world! Enjoy!

TROUBLESHOOTING:

Q) How do I get bees in Minecraft? / How do I install the current Snapshot?
A) If you're on the Java Edition of Minecraft, open the launcher. Near the bottom left of the launcher, between the "Settings" button and the "Play" button, you should see text that likely says "Latest release (1.14.4)" or something similar. Click that, then click "Latest snapshot" (currently 19w34a), then hit Play. The Minecraft launcher will download and install the snapshot for you, and once the game launches, you will be running the latest snapshot.

Q) I don't see the pride flag pack I pasted into resourcepacks in my resource pack list in game!
A) Ensure that you pasted the folder, and not the contents of it. Minecraft requires several files other than the actual modified textures themselves to be present in order for it to register in game.

Q) The "[x] Pride" listing under "Available Resource Packs" is red! / When I click the triangle to activate the resource pack, the error "Are you sure you want to load this resource pack? This resource pack was made for an older version of Minecraft and may no longer work correctly." appears. What do I do?
A) To be honest, I can't figure out how to NOT make this error appear. I created the resource pack on the only existent snapshot that has bees, and still got this error. However, provided you are on the aforementioned snapshot version (19w34a), you can safely hit the "Yes" button. It's likely that everything will still work fine on future snapshots of Minecraft, unless they majorly overhaul the bee model, making the textures I modified confused.

Should you encounter any issues with this resource pack that were not covered by the troubleshooting, please feel free to open an issue on the repository's issue tracker on Github (account required, I believe) or shoot me an ask on my Tumblr (no account required)! The link to my Tumblr's ask page will be near the bottom of this readme.

OTHER:

Thanks so much for checking out this resource pack! I know Github isn't usually the place people normally host resource packs (I don't actually know this lol it just seems like a kind of weird idea to me), but I figured the built-in issue tracker, as well as user-friendly file hierarchy viewing format would benefit the resource pack.

I do have future plans for this resource pack! Over time, I would like to add additional pride flags, so if there's a pride flag not included in this pack you would like to see, hit up my Tumblr ask box! If there's enough demand for it, or I anticipate high demand for said pride flag, I will add it (eventually[tm]). I would also like to work out how to be able to incorporate more than one pride flag per resource pack, like randomizing a bee's flag when it spawns and making it keep that flag forever, but from what I've seen I have to actually dig into Minecraft's code for that. The only other alternative I've seen is waiting for Optifine to update for Java 1.15, but since even that's a long ways away, it'll probably take less time for me to do that code thing.

I will be including a changelog.txt, in which you can view the changes between versions, in case you're interested in that sort of thing. Call me a nerd, but I've always wanted to be able to write my own changelogs lol.
